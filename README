Gowl (Go-bindings for wayland)
======
This library is ONLY for communicating with the wayland protocol. If you want to
actually create windows and similar, you'll need to write the code to do that
yourself.

Before building display.patch needs to be applied:

	patch -p 1 < display.patch

To run the test application, start weston and run:

	go run test/main.go

For now generated files are included in the git repository. If you would like to
generate the files yourself, run the following commands from the root of the
fetched repository:

	cd generator/
	go run generate.go

generate.go places the generated files in the directory above the current.
