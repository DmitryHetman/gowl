Gowl (Go-bindings for wayland)
======
This library is ONLY for communicating with the wayland protocol. If you want to
actually create windows and similar, you'll need to write the code to do that
yourself.

Before building you need to run the generator:

	cd generator/
	go run generate.go

generate.go places the generated files in the directory above the current.
After generating, display.patch needs to be applied:

	patch -p 1 < display.patch

To run the test application, start weston and run:

	go run test/main.go
