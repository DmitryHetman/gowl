Gowl (Go-bindings for wayland)
======
This library is ONLY for communicating with the wayland protocol. If you want to
actually create windows and similar, you'll need to write the code to do that
yourself.

If you want to generate the files yourself, run:

	cd generator/
	go run generate.go

generate.go places the generated files in the directory above the current.

To run the test application, start weston and run:

	go run test/main.go
