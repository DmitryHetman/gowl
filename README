Before building display.patch needs to be applied:

	patch -p 1 < display.patch

To run the test application, start weston and run:

	go run test/main.go

For now generated files are included in the git repository. If you would like to
generate the files yourself, run the following commands from the root of the
fetched repository:

	cd generator/
	go run generate.go

generate.go places the generated files in the directory above the current.
